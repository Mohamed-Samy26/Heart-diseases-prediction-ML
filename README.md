# Heart diseases prediction using Machine learning

 
## Introduction:
	
  This project aims to study the likelihood of having heart diseases,
Which is a quite interesting subject to study where:
•	Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and globally.
•	One person dies every 36 seconds in the United States from cardiovascular disease.
•	About 659,000 people in the United States die from heart disease each year, that’s 1 in every 4 deaths.

<br>
So, to help People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia ‘excessive fats’ or already established disease) who need early detection and management. <br>

I decided to analyze this subject statistically using graphical and numerical methods and train a machine learning model that can make good use of the dataset.
<br>

## Machine Learning approach:
-	To make good use of our dataset we decided to train 3 different machine learning models such that each model depends on different algorithms than the others.
-	Before being able to train the models, dataset had to be prepared first by removing duplicates, null or missing values, outliers and using dummies for categorial data (like chestPainType)
-	All models were trained using a part of the data set and tested using the other part
o	The first model was trained using multiple linear regression, it had poor accuracy of only 55%
o	Second model was trained using decision tree, and it was a great leap forward as the accuracy has improved to about 80% to 85%, depending on the random portion of dataset used during the training.
o	Third model was trained using K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and had accuracy of 85%
-	“scikit-learn” library from “Conda” environment with python 3.9 was used to train the models and “joblib” to save them as binaries for later use
-	 A Jupyter notebook was used to divide code into cells to be easy for reading and documenting along the whole study 
-	To test for an observation, the required attributes need to be passed in form of (.CSV) file to the model
-	Each model produces output of:
either (1: “have heart disease”) or (0: “Doesn’t have heart disease”)
